  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Like` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `createdAt` on the `Like` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `updatedAt` on the `Like` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The required column `id` was added to the `Like` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
